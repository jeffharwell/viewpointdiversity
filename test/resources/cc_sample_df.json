President Clinton, who has probably been a stronger supporter of abortion than any other president, has argued that abortion should be \"safe, legal and rare\". This is also the position of around 50% of American voters who argue that if abortion takes place, it should be as early in pregnancy as possible.\nRecently, opponents of abortion, such as the National Right to Life Committee and the Christian Coalition, have been focusing on a new strategy with which they have had some success - targetting so-called \"late-term\" or \"partial-birth\" abortions rather than arguing for a blanket ban.\nTo me, abortion is the greatest evil on the American continent since slavery\nAround 30 states have passed laws banning late-term procedures, but implementation has been blocked in most of them while legal challenges are under way. The anti-abortion campaign has also been hit by associations with violent extremists who have attacked abortion clinics and doctors who undertake abortions. Violent passions\nIn October 1998, an abortion provider in Buffalo New York was killed by a sniper. In the same year around a fifth of all abortion clinics reported some degree of severe violence directed against their staff or premises. I will always, always defend a woman's right to choose\nThe passions aroused by abortion also filter into many areas of political life. The anti-abortion, pro-life movement is almost exclusively on the right of the Republican party and has strong grass roots support, partly through groups like the Christian Coalition. This poses many problems for Republican candidates, as being anti-abortion has become a litmus test for a candidate's ideological credentials and many conservatives refuse to support anyone who does not take their position. This in turn has allowed Democrats to paint Republicans as extremist, but they in turn have to tread carefully to avoid being portrayed as unconcerned."}, {"warc_record_id": "<urn:uuid:0034c6d4-b7c8-412f-99e7-61531a408a96>", "relevance": "0.346127241849899291992187500000", "text": "Can the pro-choice and pro-life camps work together?\nOn May 2, 2012May 2, 2012 By Aaron AllisonIn UncategorizedtAs I prepared my sermon last week on abortion, I avoided some of the political realities surrounding this subject. Still, I prayed and prepared with the realization that there are members of our church with pro-choice political views. Which leads me to some questions:\nCan someone be anti-abortion personally and pro-choice politically?\nCan someone be pro-choice politically and evangelical?\nThese are questions I wrestled with last week, but did not make my sermon. So here are some of those thoughts:\nAs an evangelical, I have strong anti-abortion convictions that play a huge role in my political participation. So, I consider myself a strong anti-abortion proponent in public policy.\nWith that being established, let me give short answers to the questions I\u2019m considering.\nCan someone be anti-abortion personally and pro-choice politically?\nYes. It\u2019s hard for me to imagine how someone can be anti-abortion and pro-choice. However, for those with libertarian leanings, I can somewhat understand their reasoning. Still, I disagree.\nCan someone be pro-choice politically and evangelical?\nYes. An evangelical is someone who believes the Bible is the inspired Word of God, Jesus is the only way to heaven and the message of Jesus should be spread to unbelievers. Can you believe those evangelical beliefs, and still be pro-choice? Yes. For pro-choice evangelicals, I think you are wrong, but you\u2019re still an evangelical and part of our family.\nCan the pro-choice and pro-life camps ever work together to reduce abortions?\nYes. This is a new concept growing in popularity. Most pro-choice politicians claim to be personally anti-abortion. If this is the case, what are they doing to reduce the amount abortions in America? This concept emerged in 2007, when Dr. Joel C. Hunter, senior pastor of Northland Church (www.northlandchurch.net), served as a panelist during a live CNN discussion with leading Democratic presidential contenders. In a brilliant question, Hunter asked Hillary Clinton if the pro-choice and pro-life camps could work together to reduce abortions. Watch what happened here:\nA movement towards this reality has started, though I don\u2019t seen anything very substantial five years later. Regardless, this humble approach to work together to reduce abortions could make a difference in saving many lives.\nI pray that God will change America\u2019s heart towards abortion.\nSearch me, God, and know my heart; test me and know my anxious thoughts.\nSee if there is any offensive way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting \u2013 Psalms 139:23-24.\nMay God Lord Bless you and your conviction and your struggle to hold pieces together."}, {"warc_record_id": "<urn:uuid:003e3a86-58bb-493e-acd1-cca2e9fb03ff>", "relevance": "0.378851056098937988281250000000", "text": "IMO, if someone wants abortion illegal, even with exceptions, you are still PL. I get so annoyed when a PL person says \"I think abortion should be allowed for rape, incest, maternal health\" and someone comes back with \"That makes you Pro Choice\". It doesn't, Pro Choice (again IMO) means giving women all their choices, freedom to choice regardless of reason. If you are only giving her choices under special circumstances, how is that \"Pro Choice\"? I get that it isn't entirely Pro Life either, it is somewhere in the middle. **ETA**From the responses, it seems many people don't/can't separate their personal feelings from their political views. So, to be sure we are all \"on the same page\", lets keep the opinions to your political views on abortion. Do you feel the federal or state government should ban it? Place stricter regulations on it, that sort of thing. Ya now, how would YOU VOTE if the subject appeared on your ballot?\nI simply find them like people who want the title of vegetarian but eat steak or chicken. Annoying.Imo they are the worst type of \"pro-life\" person. They to be able to pick and choose morality as they see fit. I can understand (but not agree with) a person that is pro-life with no exceptions (except imminent maternal death). But if how the child was conceived matters to you you just want to be able to pass judgement.\nI AM PRO LIFE with exception, I IDENTIFY as pro life AND HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT IT WON'T CHANGE MY MIND. ANYONE'S OPINION ABOUT HOW THEY WANT TO LABEL ME IS INCONSEQUENTIAL TO MY LIFE, IT DOESN'T CHANGE A FUCKING THING.\n1 like I don't care for the wishy-washy. Some things should be black and white.\nYep. Quoting Anonymous:I agree. A pro lifer wouldn't make an exception. If you favor women having any kind of choice, you are pro choice. Quoting UgtaBkdnMe:No pro-life is pro-life. Having abortion as an option AT ALL is pro choice.\n2 likes that may be your opinion, but you are inaccurate. if you think there is ever a time when a woman should be able to make that choice to abort, you are in fact pro-choice. I mean, how much simpler can it be? by rnchelle93 October 12, 2012 at 11:16 PM\n11 likes Those who say, no abortion, but we have exceptions, scare me. They claim its life, that abortion is murder, and yet, they feel qualified to say when murder should be allowed, which life is deserving of protection. I've had many people tell me that in my case (pregnant from rape) abortion would be ok. Those people, I have no respect for. Who are they to grant me permission to, in their opinion, kill? Not that I really care what they think, but I stay away from them. I don't need their permission, or their warped view of right and wrong and the value of life. I'm 100% pro choice, BTW.\nQuoting areyouatroll:If you support legalized abortion for any reason (except death on the part of the mother), you are pro choice aka pro abortion.\nIt can go both ways. If you think pro life with exception = pro choice.. wouldn't that same point of view be pro-choice with exception of \"because i don't want no baby\" = pro life?\nI don't know which side I should be on. I consider myself pro-life bc I do believe that life begins at conception, but I don't think abortion should be illegal. So am I pro-life or pro-choice?\nHe's cheating, but im in the wrong?"}, {"warc_record_id": "<urn:uuid:00431f35-27c8-4b8e-894d-bab72a38257b>", "relevance": "0.260644167661666870117187500000", "text": "When he challenged Ted Kennedy in the 1994 U.S. Senate race, Mitt Romney used polling data to determine that he would run as a pro-choice candidate while remaining personally pro-life, according to a new book by Boston journalist Ronald Scott.\nThe Washington Examiner revealed the moment in Scott's book:\nAccording to Scott, Romney revealed that polling from Richard Wirthlin, Ronald Reagan's former pollster whom Romney had hired for the '94 campaign, showed it would be impossible for a pro-life candidate to win statewide office in Massachusetts. In light of that, Romney decided to run as a pro-choice candidate, pledging to support Roe v. Wade, while remaining personally pro-life.\nAccording to Scott's new book, Mitt Romney: An Inside Look at the Man and His Politics, Romney traveled to Salt Lake City to meet with Mormon church elders in November 1993 to lay out his public position on abortion. Some leaders were not pleased by his position, Scott reports.\nRomney stuck with his decision. In an October 1994 debate, Romney said he believed that abortion should be \"safe and legal\" and that Roe v. Wade should stand. He added, \"And my personal beliefs, like the personal beliefs of other people, should not be brought into a political campaign.\"\nSen. Kennedy seized on his stance: \"On the question of the choice issue, I have supported the Roe v. Wade. I am pro-choice. My opponent is multiple choice.\"\nRomney responded, \"I have my own beliefs and those beliefs are very dear to me. One of them is that I do not impose my beliefs on other people.\" He then told the story of a family friend who passed away from an illegal abortion. (Video of the debate above via Youtube.)\nJustin Elliott of Salon.com reported that the woman in question was Ann Keenan, the sister of Romney's brother-in-law, who died in 1963, a decade before Roe v. Wade was decided.\nAfter losing to Kennedy in a landslide, Romney campaigned as pro-choice again in his successful 2002 gubernatorial campaign. He said that he supported state-funded abortions for low-income women in a 2002 Planned Parenthood questionnaire. In a 2005 Boston Globe op-ed, Romney came out as pro-life after vetoing a bill to increase access to emergency contraception.\nWhile Romney has denied charges that he flip-flops on issues, Romney campaign spokeswoman Gail Gitcho told MSNBC that abortion is the one substantial issue that he has admitted changing his position on.\n\"I'd make sure that the progress that has been made to provide for life and to protect human life is not progress that would be reversed,\" Romney told Fox News' Mike Huckabee in October. \"My view is that the Supreme Court should reverse Roe v. Wade and send back to the states the responsibility for deciding whether they're going to have abortion legal in their state or not.\""}, {"warc_record_id": "<urn:uuid:00435351-86d1-414a-8bb2-fefcaa2cd93e>", "relevance": "0.294045448303222656250000000000", "text": "A few weeks ago we noted that since Religious Right leaders keep comparing themselves to Dietrich Bonhoeffer, it only stood to reason that they see their opponents as akin to Nazis.\nLiberty Counsel\u2019s Matt Barber, at least, has been very open about this.
